* My GNU/Emacs configuration folder
** Aims
 - Be as vimmy as possible while augmenting some commands and replacing some
   shortcuts with more useful commands.
   - E.g. change movement keys in lisp code
 - Use as much of spacemacs as possible
 - Use elements of doom config
 - Use org setup of https://github.com/novoid/dot-emacs/blob/master/config.org
 - Be more minimal than spacemacs and possibly not use evil
   - Instead use ryo-modal, xah or modalka
 - Heavy use of hydra
 - Auto entry and exiting of modes depending on pointer location
   - E.g. lispy normal mode to command mode via ]
   - Exit entry mode when a structural element is inserted - ]")
     - Major mode dependent
 - Quickly accessible navigation hierarchy:
   - Project
   - File
   - Heading
   - Function
   - Something like imenu but with a better hierarchy
 - Keep everything as structural as possible
 - Operate on a structural level as much as possible
   - E.g. org-mode, lisp and prettify for js
   - https://github.com/darwin/plastic, https://github.com/mkremins/flense
   - Think of it as a database
